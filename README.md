Forked from github.com/stretchr/testify


ktest - Thou Shalt Write Tests
==============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dave/ktest.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dave/ktest)

Go code (golang) set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend.

Features include:

  * [Easy assertions](#assert-package)
  * [Mocking](#mock-package)
  * [HTTP response trapping](#http-package)
  * [Testing suite interfaces and functions](#suite-package)

Get started:

  * Install ktest with [one line of code](#installation), or [update it with another](#staying-up-to-date)
  * For an introduction to writing test code in Go, see http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing
  * Check out the API Documentation http://godoc.org/github.com/dave/ktest
  * To make your testing life easier, check out our other project, [gorc](http://github.com/stretchr/gorc)
  * A little about [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)



[`assert`](http://godoc.org/github.com/dave/ktest/assert "API documentation") package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `assert` package provides some helpful methods that allow you to write better test code in Go.

  * Prints friendly, easy to read failure descriptions
  * Allows for very readable code
  * Optionally annotate each assertion with a message

See it in action:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/dave/ktest/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(t, 123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(t, 123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(t, object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(t, object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal(t, "Something", object.Value)

  }

}
```

  * Every assert func takes the `testing.T` object as the first argument.  This is how it writes the errors out through the normal `go test` capabilities.
  * Every assert func returns a bool indicating whether the assertion was successful or not, this is useful for if you want to go on making further assertions under certain conditions.

if you assert many times, use the below:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/dave/ktest/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
  assert := assert.New(t)

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal("Something", object.Value)
  }
}
```

[`require`](http://godoc.org/github.com/dave/ktest/require "API documentation") package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `require` package provides same global functions as the `assert` package, but instead of returning a boolean result they terminate current test.

See [t.FailNow](http://golang.org/pkg/testing/#T.FailNow) for details.

[`mock`](http://godoc.org/github.com/dave/ktest/mock "API documentation") package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `mock` package provides a mechanism for easily writing mock objects that can be used in place of real objects when writing test code.

An example test function that tests a piece of code that relies on an external object `testObj`, can setup expectations (ktest) and assert that they indeed happened:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/dave/ktest/mock"
)

/*
  Test objects
*/

// MyMockedObject is a mocked object that implements an interface
// that describes an object that the code I am testing relies on.
type MyMockedObject struct{
  mock.Mock
}

// DoSomething is a method on MyMockedObject that implements some interface
// and just records the activity, and returns what the Mock object tells it to.
//
// In the real object, this method would do something useful, but since this
// is a mocked object - we're just going to stub it out.
//
// NOTE: This method is not being tested here, code that uses this object is.
func (m *MyMockedObject) DoSomething(number int) (bool, error) {

  args := m.Called(number)
  return args.Bool(0), args.Error(1)

}

/*
  Actual test functions
*/

// TestSomething is an example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // create an instance of our test object
  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

  // setup expectations
  testObj.On("DoSomething", 123).Return(true, nil)

  // call the code we are testing
  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

  // assert that the expectations were met
  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)

}
```

For more information on how to write mock code, check out the [API documentation for the `mock` package](http://godoc.org/github.com/dave/ktest/mock).

You can use the [mockery tool](http://github.com/vektra/mockery) to autogenerate the mock code against an interface as well, making using mocks much quicker.

Installation
============

To install ktest, use `go get`:

    * Latest version: go get github.com/dave/ktest

This will then make the following packages available to you:

    github.com/dave/ktest/assert
    github.com/dave/ktest/mock

Import the `ktest/assert` package into your code using this template:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/dave/ktest/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  assert.True(t, true, "True is true!")

}
```
